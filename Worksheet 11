Problem 1

Problem 2
    a. 
        prevalence of children at 8 who wheeze with exercise, for very low birthweight is 17/384
        p = 0.17
        z = ( 0.17 - 0.062 ) / sqrt( (0.062) * (1-0.062) / 384)
    b.  
        H0: pi = 0.062
        HA: pi != 0.062
        Assumptions: Central Limit Theorem Applies
        p-value approx 0
    c. 
        Yes. More than 5 individuals with and without wheezing with exercise
    
    d. 
        p <- 0.17
        z <- 1.96
        n <- 384

        wilson = (p + (z^2 / 2 * n)) / (1+(z^2)/)

        > binconf(.17*384,384,alpha=0.05,method='wilson')
            PointEst    Lower     Upper
                0.17 0.135742 0.2107951


    e. Sign Test
            Number of children who wheeze: 104
            Number who don't: 280

            sign test 
                standard error = ( 104-280 ) / sqrt(104+280)
                               = -8.98
            Reject null hypothesis. We find that the proportion of very low birthweight children who wheeze at night is significantly different than 0.5
    
Problem 3.
    a. 
        r = above 40 ng/ml = 4
        s = below 40 ng/ml = 3
        sign test stat = 4-3 / sqrt(4 + 3 )
                       = 1 / sqrt(7)
                       z = 0.38 < 1.96
                    We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the median concentration is 40 ng/ml

    b. 
        H0: Maternal Concentration is higher than concentration 50% of the time
        HA: Maternal Concentration is higher than concentration MORE THAN 50% of the time
        r = maternal concentration higher = 4
        s = cord concentration not lower  = 3
            z = -0.38 
            |z| < 1.96
            Fail to reject H0
    c. 
        No. These tests require the central limit theorem, and we do not have a sufficiently large n to justify that assumption.
